<h1>Creating my blog with Github Pages</h1>

<p class="view">by Gregor Waldvogel</p>

<p>Wordpress seemed way too complicated for what I wanted: A simple solution to publish small posts about the problems I had and how I fixed them and talk about projects I am working on. Jekyll and Github Pages looked like a nice approach: Just write simple Markdown files for every post and add it to version control.</p>

<p>Github Pages and Jekyll are fairly easy to use, especially the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/">Jekyll documentation</a> was helpful in understanding the layout of my repository. The Github Pages documentation tells you anything else you need to know.</p>

<p>I use the  <a href="https://pages-themes.github.io/minimal/">Minimal theme</a> as my base and customized it to my needs, all in all this took me about an hour, so itâ€™s quite easy to do when you know a little HTML/CSS. Now I can start writing instead of worrying about customizing my Wordpress installation.</p>
