Wordpress seemed way too complicated for what I wanted: A simple solution to publish small posts about the problems I had and how I fixed them and talk about projects I am working on. Jekyll and Github Pages looked like a nice approach: Just write simple Markdown files for every post and add it to version control.

Github Pages and Jekyll are fairly easy to use, especially the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) was helpful in understanding the layout of my repository. The Github Pages documentation tells you anything else you need to know.

I use the  [Minimal theme](https://pages-themes.github.io/minimal/) as my base and customized it to my needs, all in all this took me about an hour, so it's quite easy to do when you know a little HTML/CSS. Now I can start writing instead of worrying about customizing my Wordpress installation.
